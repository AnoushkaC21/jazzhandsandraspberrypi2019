     <li> 1 ½ cups refried beans or 1 ½ cups drained and rinsed black beans </li>
     <li> ¾ cup corn kernels </li>
     <li> 3 cups cooked rice I like to use Uncle Ben's microwaveable Ready Rice for a quick option </li>
     <li> 6 large 10-inch flour tortillas (I like to use Mission brand "burrito size" tortillas) </li>
     <li> 1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese </li>
     <li> Optional garnish: finely diced red onion; lettuce; diced tomato or salsa; sour cream; fresh cilantro; avocado or guacamole </li>

     <p> How to make: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Preheat oven to 425°. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat 6-8 minutes or until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles; drain. Stir in taco seasoning and 1 can of undrained tomatoes; heat through. </li>
       <li> Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix beans, 1/2 cup cheese, cilantro, remaining can of undrained tomatoes and, if desired, pepper sauce. Spread onto bottom of a greased 13x9-in. baking dish </li>
       <li> Stand taco shells upright over bean mixture. Fill each with 1 tablespoon cheese and about 1/3 cup beef mixture. Bake, covered, 15 minutes. </li>
       <li> Uncover; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, 5-7 minutes or until cheese is melted and shells are lightly browned. Sprinkle with green onions. </li>
    </ol>
