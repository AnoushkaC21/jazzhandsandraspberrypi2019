      <li>280g monkfish fillet, roughly chopped</li>

      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li> sea salt </li>
      <li> ground pepper </li>
     </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a couple of tbsp of olive oil in a large paella pan or frying pan.</li>
      <li>Add the onion and cook out briefly. </li>
      <li>Add the chopped pepper and crush in the garlic. You cans season it with a little salt and add pepper and cook until softened.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the smoked paprika and saffron into the pan. Following this is the rice. Stir well so that each grain of rice is well coated in oil.</li>
      <li>Add the wine and allow it to evaporate before pouring in the hot stock.</li>
      <li>Cover the hot stock with a lid and leave it to simmer gently for 20 mins. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom.</li>
      <li> Five mins before the end of cooking (15 minutes after adding it to the hot spot) add the mussels, prawns, squid and monkfish to the pan. Stir well, and replace the lid to finish cooking.</li>
